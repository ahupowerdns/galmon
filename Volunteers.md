The galmon project is very grateful to all its volunteering receiving stations.
Additional sites are welcome (and encouraged) as the more data receiving sites 
that exist, then more accurate data and absolute coverage of each constellation can be had.

Once you have been assigned a receiver number, please submit a pull-request
against this file to update the list of locations.
